My name is Yechi Zhang, a second-year masterâ€™s student from [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), majoring in Epidemiology and Health Statistics. I will graduate in June 2024. And I got my bachelor degree of medicine at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2021. And I'm Jiapeng Liu's girl friend and I love him very much. 

Research Interest
======
Causal Inference; Epidemiology; Robust Estimation; Instrumental Variables; Mediation Analysis; Transporta- bility

Education
======
* 2021 - present, [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), Master of Medicine
* 2016 - 2021, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), Bachelor of Medicine
* 2017 - 2021, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), Minor in English

Research Experience
======
I have conducted some research on the field of epidemiology, causal inference methodologies and the related application study. My research focus during my undergraduate study at Zhejiang University was on chronic disease epidemiology. Currently, my research interests at Renmin University of China lie in developing and applying causal inference methods. 

I have been conducting some methodological research on semiparametric estimation, instrumental variables, missing data, high-dimensional data analysis and mediation analysis. I participate in three journal papers, Identification and Estimation of Spillover Effects with Invalid Instrumental Variables and Multiply Robust Estimation of Causal Effects Using Linked Data as the first-author, and Semiparametric Causal Mediation Analysis Based on Sufficient Dimension Reduction as the second-author. I am also experienced in applied research on Mendelian randomization based on GWAS summary data, in which I investigated the bidirectional causal relationship between COVID-19 and COPD.
